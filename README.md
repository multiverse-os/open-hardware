# Multiverse Open Hardware 
The collection of tools that is beginning as primarily a TinyGo firmware
development framework, and flashing tools for simplifying putting open source
BIOS and firmware on existing hardware, and design open hardware solutions for
extending the possibilities available to Multiverse OS development. A focus on
open architecture, cryptographically secure, and updated firmware; and providing
greater freedom to create and extend modern general use computing beyond black
boxes, coporate denial of moore's law collapse, unfathomable waste of rare
materials, and corporate hoarding of literal thoughts in closed production
enviornment, processes, and abhorrrent working conditions for insecure,
uninspired devices that have some years featured software upgrades, and
intential sabatoge of existing hardware.
