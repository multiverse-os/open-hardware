# LED cube

This is code for a LED cube, inspired by a LED cube I've seen at
[CCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_Communication_Congress) and the
[SquareWave Dot](https://squarewave.io/) cube.

Hardware:

  * 6 32x32 hub75 panels, for example [these](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33023473536.html).
  * [Adafruit ItsyBitsy M4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3800).
  * A power source, for example a USB power bank.
  * Something to make it a cube, for example wood (you can remove the plastic
    frame and use the small screws that remain).
  * Some wires and stuff to connect things internally.
