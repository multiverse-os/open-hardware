# Spirit level using the Circuit Play Express

This is a small ring that implements a spirit level tool, to measure whether
something is horizontal. It depends, of course, on the accuracy of the LIS3DH
accelerometer on the board.

The WS2812 ring on the board is used to indicate which part of the Circuit Play
Express is lower.
